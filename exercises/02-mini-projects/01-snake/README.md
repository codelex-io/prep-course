# üêç Snake üêç

Our goal is to create a working snake game, by finishing `Snake.ts` & `Grid.ts` alongside with the tests.

## Getting Ready

As always, open this folder in the Visual Studio Code and download all the dependencies by executing `npm install`

## Executing Tests

Open terminal and execute command: `npm test`

## Running Application

To launch the game open terminal and execute command: `npm start`, at the end of the process description you will find a URL, most likely `http://localhost:1234` so just open that in your browser.

## Game Rules

- snake can move
- snake grows by three cells each time it eats an apple
- on each level there are apples placed in random positions on the field
- snake dies if it bumps into the wall or itself
- no keypress for move is missed
